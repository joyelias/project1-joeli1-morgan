<h1>Project 1</h1>
<h4>What was the theme you chose?</h4>
<p>I made my project theme based on burgers. Burgers are one of my favorite foods because of the variety. Recently, I've been a fan pf the impossible burger.<br>
<h4>How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?</h4>
<p>The project is set to display recipes based on burgers.<br>
<h4>What are at least 3 issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?</h4>
<p>1. I followed the powerpoint slides to create the project and the powerpoint was helpful with the parsing aspect of spoontacular.<br>
<p>2. Trying to get the image to show was a STRUGGLE! I'm still working on updating that.<br>
<p>3. I wasn't sure how the tweets should appear. I have the tweets at the bottom but it doesn't always display the name of the user.<br>
<h4>What are known problems, if any, with your project?</h4>
<p>I don't know how to filter the tweets to keep them PG or PG-13. Please excuse any tweets that don't follow those guidelines.<br>
<h4>What would you do to improve your project in the future?</h4>
<p>I want to update the styling to make it more user friendly.<br>
